## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the ELMS assignment.

### Part 2 (75 pts)

First, I would inform my boss, and see their reaction. See how the next few days go, whether or not it looks like they're planning on addressing the issue. I do *not* want people to die, so I'll go pretty far to prevent that. If it looks like they're going forward with just ignoring it, I want to see if it was just the boss covering their ass, not anything the higher ups are endorsing. Cause if so, I'd attempt to alert higher-ups and see what happens.

Ultimately, I'm hoping that the company does something, and I'll do the best within my company to address the issue. But if not, then it's time to go outside. I doubt I'd try to release to the public directly -- that's a bad idea -- but instead leverage consumer watchdogs to do something, hopefully anonymously.

I wouldn't want to do things recklessly, since whistle-blowers are never treated well, and that would make it harder to get hired elsewhere, most likely. But I think I would be willing to resign from my job to get something done.

If, despite any of this action, or even if I can't work the courage up to do more intense parts of it, I don't believe it would be my fault. My job would be reporting it and trying at least a bit to prevent bad things from happening. But if I can't get things done, the people responsible would ultimately be the higher-ups, not me. They're the one making the bad decisions to get the bullshit going, and having the devs develop bad firmware in the first place. So I would really angry, but I would've tried my best, and quite possibly could've gone quite far, to save people's lives. I don't think anyone could ask for anything more than that.
